## Usage

Drag your clothing prefab into the Unity hierarchy at the base of your scene.

Open `Window` > `SophieBlue` > `AvatarDresser` from the menu bar.  In the
AvatarDresser window, drag your avatar and the clothing prefab into the
appropriate places, then simply click `Get Dressed!`

You can also check the box for `Create Animations` - this will create
appropriate enable/disable animations for your clothing item, add a layer to
your FX animator, and add a toggle to the selected menu.

## Installation

Install the unitypackage the usual way, from the menu bar in Unity, going
`Assets` then `Import Package` then `Custom Package...` and selecting the file.
